    "This experiment is based on the oddball paradigm used in [Luck et al., (2009)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00817.x). In the oddball paradigm, a letter or digit was presented every 1100-1500 ms. Subjects were instructed to press a button with one hand for digits and with the other hand for letters. For a given trial block, either the letters or the digits were rare (20%) and the other category was frequent (80%). The stimulus category (digits or letters), the probability (80% or 20%) and the hand used for response (left or right) were counterbalanced, leading to 8 experimental conditions. The probability manipulation was designed to isolate the probability-sensitive P300 component. Different event codes were used for the digits when they were rare (`20_Dig_L` for response with left hand, `20_Dig_R` for response with right), the digits when they were frequent (`80_Dig_L`, `80_Dig_R`), the letters when they were rare (`20_Let_L`, `20_Let_R`), and the letters when they were frequent (`80_Let_L`, `80_Let_R`). These event codes are summarized below:\n",

    "|Left/Right|Rare|Frequent|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|Digits|20_Dig_L/20_Dig_R|80_Dig_L/80_Dig_R|\n",
    "|Letters|20_Let_L/20_Let_R|80_Let_L/80_Let_R|\n",

    "The P300 is a neural marker of surprise. As such, we expect a larger P300 during the rare trials than for the frequent trials. In this notebook, you will analyze the difference (if any) in P300s between conditions. Specifically, you will (1a) perform permutation testing, and (1b) visualize the evoked potentials. After this, you will (2) do a time-frequency analysis to identify a signature of conflict in the theta (4-8 Hz) band.\n",
